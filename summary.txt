Goal!: The Dream Begins ,When Santiago Munez (KUNO BECKER) is given the chance of a lifetime,
he must leave his family, his life in Los Angeles and everything that he knows to travel 
halfway around the globe to England and into a completely foreign world - the exciting,
fast-paced and glamorous world of international soccer.

As an underprivileged Mexican-American immigrant growing up in the poor section of Los Angeles, 
Santiago seemed destined to follow his father's path in life: laboring at menial jobs to earn just enough money to support his family.
 Naturally gifted, his amazing talent on the soccer field was wasted in recreation league games while he could only dream 
of playing on the world stage of professional soccer. 
But when a British scout (STEPHEN DILLANE) discovers his talent and gets him a tryout with one of England's premier soccer clubs,
Newcastle United, Santiago must choose between his father's fate and his own destiny.

Now alone in a world where soccer is a religion and players are gods,
this underdog must prove that he's got the talent and determination to make it amongst the best in the world.

Moral of the story: Self confidence,Don't give up in situation.
